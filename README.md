The goal of this shiny app is to make CIU scoring faster, easier, and
more reliable.

You can run the app from R on your computer by using the following code
(note, this will automatically install any needed packages).

``` r
# not run
install.packages('shiny')
library(shiny)
shiny::runGitHub('rbcavanaugh/ciu_analysis', subdir = 'rungithub')
```

Or access it at shinyapps.io:
